Many Cali producers add a touch of oak to Viognier, but Clay Station avoids the wood in order to allow the grape's wonderful aromatics to come to the fore. As this full-bodied, floral- and ripe peach-scented wine shows, their decision was wise. A great choice for either spicy barbecue fare or curry dishes.",,,"2011-01-07 09:38:42.95129"

It certainly didn't hurt that climatic conditions worked in their favour. In June 2009, Peter Richards wrote in Decanter magazine: 'The 2007 vintage in Chile was spectacular for red wine. A long, cool season resulted in naturally low yields (on average 15-30% down from 2006), slow maturation and a late harvest (up to three weeks later than 2006 for many reds). For the wines, this meant good colour, fresh natural acidity and low alcohol levels. All in all, a vintage that majors on drinkability over power, which combines a rare ability to age with a seductive, come-hither openness, and which should reward those looking for elegance, complexity and freshness.' The Borobo promises a smooth and juicy attack with ripe black and red fruits, spices and notes of tobacco. There's wonderful harmony here and a lasting finish.",,,"2011-01-07 09:33:44.722763"
